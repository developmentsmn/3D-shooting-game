# HOWL

## Storyline

Very long ago, the monsters once existed. They were strong, tough, and evil, destroying everything that appeared in their path. The humans were weak and failed to protect themselves. Eventually, the Sky Guardians were sent to ground and sealed those monsters in the hell jail. One day, one Sky Guardian betrayed and broke the seal door, releasing all the monsters back to ground. Where were the Sky Guardians? We don't know. One more time, the humans had to fight for themselves.
